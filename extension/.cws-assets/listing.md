## Single purpose
Enhance Salesforce Flow Builder and Setup with productivity features including flow analysis, in-canvas search, scheduled-flow discovery, deploy/rollback via local CLI, and optional AI assistance.

## Permission justifications

### storage
Saves user preferences and per-feature toggle settings to chrome.storage.local so the user can disable individual features and configure the optional local-CLI bridge connection.

### clipboardWrite
Lets the user one-click copy generated API names, compare-report data, and SOQL results to the clipboard.

### cookies
Reads the user's existing Salesforce session cookie on the Salesforce tab so the extension can authenticate Tooling API and REST calls to the user's own org. No cookies are ever sent off-origin.

### scripting
Required to inject the helper UI (side panel, in-canvas markers, Setup tab additions) into Flow Builder and Setup pages.

### host_permissions: https://*.salesforce.com/*, https://*.salesforce-setup.com/*, https://*.my.salesforce.com/*, https://*.lightning.force.com/*
The extension only operates on Salesforce origins. Required to inject UI and call the Tooling/REST APIs of the user's logged-in org.

### host_permissions: http://localhost/*, http://127.0.0.1/*
Optional connection to the user's local sfdt CLI HTTP bridge (default port 7654) for Flow Deploy, Rollback, and AI Assistant features. Disabled until the user starts the bridge themselves.
