# Changelog

All notable changes to `@sfdt/extension` are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Flow Scanner** — the `flow-quality` feature is now a full scanner. Beyond the score banner it renders the complete `@sfdt/flow-core` report: issue families (sorted by score impact) with severity, affected elements/resources, and the recommended fix, plus a Dependencies list (Apex actions, LWCs, subflows, Apex-defined types). It's also registered on real Salesforce pages (`content.ts`), so it works across Setup and Flow-list contexts by API name — not only inside the Flow Builder canvas like `flow-health-check`.
- **Org release badge** — the Workspace top bar now shows the org's Salesforce release (e.g. `Summer '26`) and flags preview instances with `(preview instance)`, matching the CLI's `monitor org-info` wording. Derived best-effort from the org's `/services/data` REST version list via the shared `@sfdt/flow-core` release logic (same "ahead of GA = preview" rule the CLI uses); the badge stays hidden if the release can't be read.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **`show-api-names`** — annotate Lightning record detail pages with each field's API name next to its label (layout-describe driven, so duplicate labels resolve in layout order) and the object API name + 18-char record id in the header. Persistent on/off toggle plus copy helpers for the current record: 18-char Id, Apex `insert` statement (createable fields, typed literals), and a `SELECT` SOQL query.

### Fixed
- **`ai-assistant` now shows the AI's answer.** "Run via sfdt" previously confirmed receipt with a toast and discarded the response; it now renders the response (with provider and a copy button) in the panel, disables the button while running, and uses the long-running bridge timeout (60s) instead of the 8s default that real AI runs routinely exceeded.
- **`flow-version-manager` bulk delete no longer blanket-overrides `confirm()`.** The bypass now auto-accepts at most one native confirm per selected version and restores the original immediately after the last one, so an unrelated confirm firing in the same window can no longer be silently accepted.
- **`missing-descriptions` surfaces fetch failures.** A failed Flow-metadata fetch now shows an error toast (once per page load) instead of silently rendering nothing, so "no flags" is distinguishable from "check never ran".
- **Fewer false-positive trigger conflicts** (`flow-health-check`, `flow-trigger-explorer`). The bundled `@sfdt/flow-core` analysis now reads a record-triggered flow's event from `recordTriggerType` — previously every save-triggered flow's event read as "Unknown", collapsing distinct Create-only and Update-only flows into one conflict bucket.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-29

A Workspace-focused release: three new live-org tools, an Apex test runner, and a redesigned tabbed Workspace where tools keep their state instead of being dismissed by a stray click — plus a shared analysis rulebook with the rest of the SFDT suite via `@sfdt/flow-core`.

### Added
- **`code-coverage`** — Apex Code Coverage tool: org-wide percentage plus per-class bands (worst-covered first, the 75% deploy line flagged red). Reads the live org directly via the Tooling/REST client — no `sfdt ui` server required.
- **`org-health-live`** — Org Health (Live): runs checks against the org instead of reading a stale snapshot (Apex coverage, inactive users 90d+, license utilisation, Apex API-version spread, limits near cap). Resilient via `Promise.allSettled` — one failed query degrades to a red row, not a dead panel.
- **`dependency-explorer`** — "what references this / what does this reference" via `MetadataComponentDependency`, for Apex/Flow/field/page/LWC by name.
- **`apex-test-runner`** — run Apex tests asynchronously (`runTestsAsynchronous` + poll) from the Workspace.
- **`bridge-tools`** — surfaces the bridge request kinds (drift / scan / compare / quality) as Workspace tools.

### Changed
- **Tabbed Workspace.** Tools now open as persistent tabs in the main area instead of fixed overlays over the page. Each tab keeps its DOM and state when you switch away, only the tab's × closes it, and a stray background click can no longer discard a half-written query or form. New shared `present-view` presenter (classic modal on a Salesforce page, tab pane in the Workspace) and a unit-tested `workspace-tabs` lifecycle; all stateful editors and the remaining flow/Workspace tools were migrated, with live-resource teardown (event-monitor CometD stream, data-import workers) now running on tab close.
- **`flow-quality` runs Direct in the browser.** It fetches the Flow's metadata via Tooling and runs the shared `@sfdt/flow-core` rulebook in-browser, so it works for any user on any org without `sfdt ui` running — byte-identical scores to the CLI.
- **Shared analysis rulebook.** `code-coverage`, `dependency-explorer`, and `org-health-live` now import their pure logic from `@sfdt/flow-core` (one source of truth across CLI/GUI/extension); `org-health-live` sheds ~170 lines of duplicated logic and the usage bands unify to amber ≥75% / red ≥90%.
- **`drift-check`** gains a "Run live (slower)" option that triggers a full live drift before returning the snapshot.

### Fixed
- **`flow-deploy` Rollback** was dead (hard-coded to version 1, used the raw flow id, always errored). It now resolves the Flow's api name and deactivates it (toVersion 0), reporting success or failure.
- Fixed several latent listener leaks (soap-explore history click handler, inspect-record and ai-assistant Esc handlers) — now torn down on close.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed
- `org-health` — the `BRIDGE_UNAUTHORIZED` error hint pointed at a non-existent `sfdt extension token` command. It now directs users to paste the bridge token from `~/.sfdt/bridge-token` (created when you run `sfdt ui`), matching the actual pairing flow.

### Changed
- Corrected the stale bridge-token rotation comment in `lib/settings.ts` (the old `sfdt extension token rotate` command does not exist) to describe the real flow: delete `~/.sfdt/bridge-token`, restart the bridge, and re-pair.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-24

> Version note: there is no 0.3.1 — the bump went straight from 0.3.0 to 0.3.2.

### Added
- `org-health` — **Org Health panel**: a side-button panel (modeled on `org-limits`) that surfaces the CLI's audit and monitor snapshots in the extension via the local bridge's new `org-health` request kind, rendering status dots, findings, and a Copy JSON action. Completes the fourth surface for the org-health feature set alongside the CLI, the web dashboard, and the VS Code extension.

### Changed
- `apex-anonymous` — **richer log capture & debugging**: adds SOQL builders, trace-flag management, and UI updates for executing and inspecting anonymous Apex (builds on the feature introduced in 0.3.0).
- **Internal namespace standardised to `sfdt`** across the extension (DOM ids, CSS classes, `chrome.storage` keys, log prefixes) so it matches the rest of the `@sfdt/*` project.

### Note
- The `chrome.storage.local` keys were renamed to the `sfdt.*` namespace with no migration shim. Users upgrading from an older build will start from default settings (and their opt-in telemetry resets); re-enabling preferences is a one-time step.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Standalone Workspace tab** (`chrome-extension://…/app.html`) — a full-page workspace opened from the side button's "Open Workspace ↗". Tools run in their own browser tab, so dismissing a panel never costs the user their place on the Salesforce page. The Workspace hands features a synthetic window reporting the chosen org's Salesforce URL, satisfying both the API host derivation and each feature's `detectContext()` gate with zero per-feature edits (`CONTEXTS.WORKSPACE`, curated `WORKSPACE_TOOLS` allowlist).
- `apex-anonymous` — **Execute Anonymous Apex**: run anonymous Apex (`executeAnonymous`) with a snippet library.
- `debug-log-viewer` — **Debug Log Viewer**: list `ApexLog` records and view raw log bodies; honours the `pageSize` feature setting.
- `org-switcher` — **Multi-Org Switcher**: discover orgs the user is logged into (via a background `listSalesforceOrgs` action over `sid` cookies, deduped) and target tools at a chosen org.
- `saved-soql` — **Saved SOQL**: bookmark and re-run SOQL queries / history, loaded into the runner via a pending-query hand-off; honours the `showHistory` feature setting.

### Changed
- `salesforce-api` — `SalesforceApiClient` gains an explicit `targetOrigin` (+ `configureSalesforceApi` singleton binding) so it works from the `chrome-extension://` origin, plus `apiGetText()` for `text/plain` bodies (e.g. ApexLog).
- Feature `ICONS` map extracted to `lib/feature-icons.ts`, shared by `content.ts` and the Workspace shell.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-17

> Version-only republish — the bump was forced by a deploy issue. No feature or
> functional code changes; the entries below are metadata/listing copy only.

### Changed
- Broadened the extension's manifest description to reflect that it now spans Flow Builder, Setup, Object Manager, and record pages (schema/data/API tooling + AI), not just Flow analysis and Setup. Also refreshed the Chrome Web Store listing copy to match (24 features, broadened positioning) and consolidated the store-submission assets under `extension/store-assets/`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added
- `export-for-prompt` — **Export Schema for Prompt**: copy a dense Markdown schema for a Salesforce object to the clipboard for pasting into an LLM prompt. Works on record pages and Lightning **Object Manager** setup pages; resolves the object from the Object Manager URL segment or the record-page key-prefix, with a Tooling `EntityDefinition` fallback for durable-id URLs, and uses the REST describe endpoint for the full field list (label, type, required, inline help).
- `soql-runner` — **LangGraph Node generator**: a button that turns the current SOQL query and its result columns into a ready-to-paste LangGraph node definition (Pydantic result model + node stub).

### Changed
- `sfdt-bridge` — per-call `timeoutMs` option; deploy/rollback use a 60s long-running timeout; idempotent bridge kinds retry once on transport failure (mutating kinds and auth errors never retry); unsafe `response.data` casts replaced with a `getBridgeData<T>` runtime guard.
- `salesforce-api` — user-facing request errors shortened to HTTP status + extracted Salesforce message (full per-host detail moved to `console.error`); SOAP lookups match by `localName`, so namespace-prefixed (`<soapenv:…>`) envelopes parse correctly.
- `telemetry` — bridge failures tracked by category (offline/timeout/unauthorized/protocol/other) via an `onBridgeFailure` hook, emitted fire-and-forget.
- `background` — kill-switch ping retries once before reporting the bridge down.
- `feature-registry` — feature init failures surface a toast (teardown errors stay console-only).
- DOM updates across features use `replaceChildren()` instead of `innerHTML = ''`.
- `SalesforceApiClient.apiVersion` is now public/readonly, and remaining `any` casts in `soql-runner`/`event-monitor` were replaced with proper types.

### Fixed
- `export-for-prompt` is now reachable — it was missing from the `content.ts` ICONS map, so the menu builder dropped it and it could never activate.
- `killswitch-cache` — cached reads age out entries older than 24h (the timestamp was written but never checked); un-stamped legacy entries are treated as stale.
- `soql-runner`/`event-monitor` — GraphQL traversal uses type guards, fixing a latent crash on null records; `BayeuxMessage` is properly typed.

### Security
- `escapeCell` (`export-for-prompt`) escapes backslashes before pipes, closing an incomplete-Markdown-escaping issue (CodeQL `js/incomplete-sanitization`).
- `salesforce-api` error logging passes dynamic values as separate `console.error` arguments rather than interpolating them into the format string (CodeQL `js/tainted-format-string`).
- `generateLangGraphNode` escapes backslashes and double-quotes in the embedded SOQL so a query cannot break out of the generated Python triple-quoted string.
- `SF_ID_RE` now matches exactly 15 or 18 characters (it previously also accepted invalid 16/17-char strings).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added
- `inspect-record` — **Inspect Record (Show All Data)**: view a record's complete field set (including empty and system fields) via the REST API. Available on record pages, Setup, and Flow Builder.
- `data-import` — **Data Import Wizard**: guided CSV-based data import into the org, with delimiter handling and CSV (de)serialization.
- `field-creator` — **Bulk Field Creator**: create multiple custom fields at once. Available on record pages, Object Manager / Setup, and Flow Builder.
- `metadata-retrieve` — **Metadata Retrieve & Deploy**: retrieve and deploy metadata directly from the browser.
- `soap-explore` — **SOAP API Explorer**: build and send SOAP API requests with a payload editor and response viewer.
- `event-monitor` — **Event Streaming Monitor**: subscribe to and monitor platform/streaming events live.

### Changed
- `soql-runner` — added field/object **autocomplete** while composing queries, alongside the existing history and CSV export.
- Expanded `context-detector` page-context mapping so the new features surface on the appropriate Setup, Flow Builder, Flow Trigger Explorer, and record pages.

### Security
- Hardened the optional `@sfdt/cli` GUI bridge: the `plugins` config key can no longer be set via the `PATCH /api/config` endpoint, closing a dynamic-`import()` code-execution path (security review M1).
